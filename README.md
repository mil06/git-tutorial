Notes
- If you are using http to connect to Github, you will be prompted for a username / password when push your changes. You will need to create and supply a personal access token (PAT) instead of your password. This was a change implemented by Github in 2021 to strengthen security. https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token 
- You may run into a merge conflict if for example a fellow D&A team member is updating the same line. Try to resolve the conflict, you'll see in option in Github if one does arise.
